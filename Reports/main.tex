\section{Evaluating the Extension of Wall Displays with AR for Collaborative Work}
    \subparagraph{by 3 : R.James, A.Bezerianos, O.Chapuis}

                \textnormal{In the context of using a LHRD, this tehcnology is meant to leave a lot of unused space, which this article offers to
                use, and moreover to make it significantly useful for users to manipulate datas thanks to LHRD. And in order to fulfill this goal
                the searchers wanted/needed to use some AR technology. And precisely using their words, "using AR to increase the shared
                workspace available to collaborators by utilizing the pysical space in front and around the wall display".}}

                \textnormal{Globally, it shows how the use of LHRD has helped to significantly increase the quality of data analysis, leading to 
                new discoveries and research. And this said, it's obvious that their not meant to be replaced in the sooner years. But they still
                is a major disadvantage : their size...}
