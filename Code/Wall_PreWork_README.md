The aim of this pre-work is to understand how developping on the wall is done :

	In order to do that, the idea of this project is to have a main panel divided into 4 equal parts (cf scheme1)
	here is the first structure I'd like to implement :
		- 4 same prefab-based GameObjects representing the screens (4 Areas/Shapes)
		- 1 big screen regrouping the 4 players GameObjects
		- 1 specific GameObject representing the ControlPad (1 Area/Shape )
		- X shapes which the operator is able to manipulate 
			-> ONLY by clicking onto these shapes in his control panel
