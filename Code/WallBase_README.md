So here's the main project that'll be used direclty on the wall (finally !).

This is quite the same as 'Mini-Wall' but here we wanna use a bunch of '.sh' files to deploy the program, and especially we wanna 
use correct parameters and code architecture to properly start this project (as we're using a LHRD we'll need to be carreful). 

So WallBase is as it says the 'base' of this code, that simply connects all computers to the program, and allow the operator to manipulate a shape along the scene, displaying this all around the wall displays.
